        "StaRS (Stacked Rapid Sand) Filtration is crucial to the water treatment process. As one of the last steps in AguaClara’s water treatment, StaRS filters are responsible for removing the last of the unwanted particles. In order to operate effectively under EPA standards, the filters must reduce the turbidity to 0.3 NTU or less. In efforts to better refine the AguaClara filters, variables such as grain size, the height of the active zone, coagulant dosage will be tested in order to increase the failure time. At the beginning of experimentation, the Fall 2019 StaRS sub-team focused specifically on the grain size. The Spring 2021 team will also work on increasing failure time, although their methods have not been determined yet. "

        "## Introduction\n",
        "The Spring 2021 team consists of new members, planning on first understanding the mathematical modeling behind sand filtration. After a thorough understanding has been reached, the Spring 2021 team plans on adding to the research produced by previous years’ teams in order to increase the failure time of the filters and testing the efficiency of the sand grain size on the filters. \n",
        "Sand filtration has been a method of water filtration since ancient times. A common type of sand filtration utilized in AguaClara water treatment plants is rapid (gravity) sand filtration. This method requires the use of polyaluminum (PaCl) as a chemical coagulant to increase the clustering of small particles (flocs) in the water in efforts to increase the ease of particle filtration. This filtration approach has shown to be effective in reducing turbidity below 0.3, which meets EPA standards. Experimentation performed on the model sand filter in the lab and the similar StaRS filters in the water treatment plants in Honduras have also reflected such performance standards. The goal of the StaRS Filter Theory sub-team is to build a mathematical model that describes the performance of the filter. Therefore, the relevant filter parameters must be determined through experiments. These parameters can be used to optimize filter performance to minimize effluent turbidity and maximize failure time. The filter parameters studied in the past include the dosage of coagulant, water inlet flow rate, water inlet turbidity, backwash time and flocculation size. The Fall 2019 team ran experiments that analyzed the performance of the 3 new sand filters. These filters were built based on earlier teams’ research that showed larger sand grains would have shorter failure times. This semester the 2021 StaRS subteam will focus on the effect of sand size on the height of the active zone and create a model to estimate the depth of the active zone of the filters. Given that StaRS filters perform rather well even with only 20 cm of bed depth,our team expects that the active zone height is a tiny fraction of 20 cm. Each of the filters contains a layer of sand, differing in their sand grain size. The StaRS team will use this existing set up to measure performance as a function of time with a constant 5 NTU influent and a range of coagulant dosages. Then, the team will calculate the mass of particles captured by the filters during the ripening period and during the total filter run until failure.\n"

Current options include continuing research on sand grain size and possibly the geometry of the filters.\n",

        "## **Literature Review**\n",
        "---\n",
        "The team conducted a literature review to understand existing research on sand filtration, especially looking at the research done on sand grain size as a factor to effective water filtration. Many research investigations were executed to determine the optimal sand grain size to prolong each run for water filtration. The team understood that the size was a factor but did not have a wide scope of understanding on the extent of this factor or other relative variables. One study <!--which study? please cite at the first point you mention a study--> noted that the larger the grain size, the faster the wastewater flowed through the sand and the greater the amount of wastewater that can be filtered. This was noted with the addition that if the grain size is too large, treatment efficiency would be reduced. This supported the team's intention of seeking the optimal sand grain size for longer failure time purposes. The research found that coarser sand provided less of a concern for clogging (Converse and Tyler, 2000). The ideal sand for intermittent sand filters is coarse sand with an effective size between 0.3mm and 0.5mm (Crites and Tchobanoglous, 1998; Ohio State University, 1999). Such statements provides a helpful starting point for the team to consider what sand grain sizes to run tests for. The published paper also emphasized the significance of the pore space in the sand,\n",
        " as opposed to attention given to the grain particles themselves. While the percentage of void volume generally remains constant as the diameter of spheres changes, the surface area of packed spheres (sand grains, in this case), increases and the size of pores per unit volume area decreases with smaller diameter spheres. An important note was that a granular media filter can improve on filtration efficiency from increases in the surface area per unit of volume, but can suffer in efficiency when the pore size is reduced by too much for sufficient flow during filtration (Ball, 1997). This consideration of the pore size rather than the grain size is an important perspective to take on the team's manipulation of sand grain size. This published paper has provided useful background to help the team proceed with planning test runs. The parameters and explanations of significance have helped the team understand the effect of certain variables on the failure time. In addition, the ranges for sand grain size stated in the literature reviewed has provided a helpful consideration for a starting point for future test runs.\n",

        "In the Spring of 2019, the StaRS team focused on the grain size effect on the efficiency of the filters. The end goal being to develop a mathematical model that best describes the efficiency of a filter and the variables that affect failure time. When experimentation began for this team, the filters showed signs of leaking and the team spent most of the semester fabricating a new filter to replace the leaking one. \n",

        "The Fall 2019 StaRS filter team developed a new apparatus in order to simplify the variability of the old design. The most prominent simplification in the new design was the decision to run only one filter (with one of the grain sizes) at a time rather than all three at once. This simplification allows for the use of only two turbidimeters, rather than the four requiered in the past design. One turbidimeter is used for influent flow and the other for effluent flow. Additionally, unlike past designs, the water enters the apparatus and immediately goes through the water pump in both the forward and backwash cycles. This change eliminated the unwanted cycling of wastewater through the system during backwash that was observed by the Fall 2019 team.  \n",
        "\n",
        "While the apparatus can only flow through one filter at a time, all three grain sizes can still be tested. There are three location on each filter column that can manually be adjusted to change which filter and therefore which sand grain size is undergoing experimentation. These location include the top, middle, and bottom inlet/outlets of the filter column. While not in use, these outlets will have plugs in them to maintain pressure and ensure water, sand, and other particles are not leaking out of the filter column.\n",
        "\n",
        "An additional adjusment made by the 2019 StaRS filter subteam was the use of consistent pipe sizing. In years prior, the diameter of tubing varied with location within the apparatus. This design leads to inconsisten pressure throughout the apparatus and therefore inconsistent water flow. By creating a design with consistent piping, the variabiliy of water flow is eliminated. In deciding which tubing size to use, it was necessary to measure the amount of kinetic energy a chosen pipe size would create throughout the system. The 2019 StaRS team chose .17in pipes and the calculations showed acceptable kinetic energy so the apparatus was designed using this size throughout the system. \n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, the Fall 2019 StaRS subteam replaced the pump previously used in the apparatus. It was discovered that while the old pump could provide enough flow of water to the filters during forward flow, it could not produce a strong enough flow rate for backwash. The backwash flow rate needed is six times the flow rate needed for forward flow. The new pump is able to accomidate for this speed. This new apparatus requires slightly more manual adjustments than previous designs, however, the simplification lends itself to a better understanding of the apparatus as a whole.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Spring 2020 StaRS team inherited the apparatus of the previous semester and will start moving forward with the testing of sand grain size after completing the design and adding a few small changes. First, the team made a new flocculator for the system as the old one was molding and made with the wrong tubing size. Additionally, the coagulant and clay pumps needed to be connected to the system. The previous semester's team had only run the apparatus with water as they were waiting to receive parts required to run the other pumps. Lastly, the team found that an error in ProCoda has been causing troubles in the functionality of the water pump. In order to move forward with experimentation the team decided to run the system by manually adjusting the water pump until ProCoda has been fixed and can function without manual help. With these adjustments the apparatus is now ready to be with clay and coagulant.  \n",

        "The team also needed to determine the orifice size for the inlet pipes into the filters. Previous teams determined this size using equation 1. However, the reasoning behind the equation and the influence of orifice size on the filter has yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, the team chose to use the same orifice dimensions as the inlet pipe for the previous apparatus, which is 0.8 cm x 2.25 cm, located 0.2 cm from the end of the inlet pipe (Fig. 4).\n",
